                    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                    <p class="indent">
                        <img style="float:left;width:10%; height:10%" src="/img/logo.png"><p class="indent">The Village is centered around the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) chatroom called #thevillage. That’s why we’re also known as The IRC Village. You’ll find conversation about mental illness as well as random life subjects because we’re people, not just patients. If we happen to be talking about pizza or something else mundane and you have a mental health question, just pop your interest into the room. That’s what we’re here for, and most likely people will focus on to the chat to be with you.</p>

                        <p class="indent">Mental illness affects everyone in the life of the person with the illness. Our community includes some family and friends. Naturally we are primarily made up of people who are dealing with a personal mental illness diagnosis. It’s amazing what can happen when you see someone dealing with what you’re dealing with, feel the same emotions they describe. Support doesn’t require that, of course, but it sure can be mutually beneficial when a contact is made and conversation is carried on.</p>
                        
                        <p class="indent">That said, this is where I get redundant in case people are skimming and missed it the first time: We are not medical professionals. We cannot provide you with a diagnosis, with medical advice, or replace your provider. Many of us have a good deal of experience with meds and symptoms and everyone has a different degree to which they’ll share about it. We have a generally very open group, so questions get asked innocently. If you ever feel you don’t want to answer a question, just say so. You don’t have to explain why. It’s cool.  Please note: before taking any advice, especially regarding meds, please contact a physician or another provider. Not everyone realizes they’re not a doctor.</p>
                        
                        <p class="indent">It’s okay to talk about feeling very depressed and low and share ideas and advice but please refrain from posting suicide threats in the chatroom. We require this because it’s a massive trigger for a lot of people. We do have lots of supportive folks, though. Don’t be afraid to just say you’re really struggling and ask if anyone’s available to talk privately. Thanks for understanding. Please check out the Resources page if you’re in this situation.</p>
