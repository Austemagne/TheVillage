Welcome to The Village <a href="/chat">chatroom</a> and <a href="/forum">forum</a> community. We mutually support one another and welcome new people every day. Our primary focus is the support of people whose lives are touched by mental illness. This could be the person who is ill, a family member, a friend, or anyone who genuinely cares for someone whether or not that person has yet been diagnosed.

                        This is an international community for adults age 18+. Please note that we set the room as adult not only in age, but also in behavior. We can get a little silly, it is a great way to let off steam and anxiety. Petulance, snobbery, hissy fits, sulking, using others as punching bags, etc., will not be tolerated.

                        <b><em><u>This is important</u></em></b>: If you, or someone you care about is in crisis, and you need help please, <b>please</b></please> contact emergency services in your area immediately and/or use the contacts on our <a href="/resources">Resources</a> page. We are not professionals. We cannot treat or even intervene. Consider the fact that many of us are in different phases of healing from our own breaks. We are simply people whose lives involve mental illness. We can share based on our experiences only. When the crisis has passed, we can help with the recovery effort, supporting the person as they get their footing again.

                        Those with their own <b>IRC client</b>, configure it to the server mellochat.xyz or irc.mellochat.com (NOTE: that is dot com, not dot net) with port 6667, then type "/join #thevillage" and chat away with us in no time. I suggest the <b>client</b> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html">HexChat.</a> Remember, if you have any questions just log into the the chat webclient or a client and ask away.
